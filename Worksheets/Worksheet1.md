## Histograms

### In 1879, Albert Michelson measured the speed of light using a rotating mirror method that involved 100 different measurements. The data consisted of five experiments, each consisting of 20 consecutive ``runs''. Below we have a random sample from this data. The response is the speed of light measurement, suitably coded (km/sec, with 299000 subtracted

| Measurement number | Experiment | Run | Speed |
|-|-|-|-|
|074 | 4 | 14 | 860
|097 | 5 | 17 | 950
|004 | 1 | 4 | 1070
|089 | 5 | 9 | 820
|003 | 1 | 3 | 900
|069 | 4 | 9 | 750
|077 | 4 | 17 | 840
|068 | 4 | 8 | 740
|067 | 4 | 7 | 760
|044 | 3 | 4 | 860
|075 | 4 | 15 | 880
|031 | 2 | 11 | 830
|096 | 5 | 16 | 940
|093 | 5 | 13 | 810

#### Problems

1. Create a histogram with class intervals of 50 for the data.
2. Notice that there is an outlier in the histogram above. Instead use the rule
\[
\text{number of classes}\approx \sqrt{\text{number of observations}}
\]
 to construct a new histogram.
3. Construct a histogram with unequal class widths (you choose!) that obeys the rule
\[
\text{rectangle height} = \frac{\text{relative frequency of the class}}{\text{class width}}
\]

4.  Calculate the mean of the data and compare this the actual speed of light.

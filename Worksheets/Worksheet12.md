<h4> Problems: </h4>

1. Calculate a 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution for the average difference in the scores. How does this number differ from the z-distribution? What can you conclude?


<h3> A recent study from the University of Virginia looked at the effectiveness of an online sleep therapy program in treating insomnia. They took 45 random adults who suffered from insomnia. 22 of them were randomly selected to participate in the therapy program while the remaining 23 served as a control group. They scored each individual using an Insomnia Severity Index, and hoped to prove that the participants in the program would have a lower score. For the 22 subjects who participated in the program, the average score was 6.59, with a standard deviation of 4.10. For the 23 subjects in the control group, the average score was 15.50, with a standard deviation of 5.34.

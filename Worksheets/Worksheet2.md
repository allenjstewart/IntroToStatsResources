### Suppose a random variable has the following probability distribution function:\[f(x)=\begin{cases}c(1-x^2)&\qquad -1\le x\le 1\\0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\]

<hr style="height: 2px; background-color: #003282;">

#### Problems

1. What must $c$ be equal to for this to be a valid distribution?
2. What is the probability that $X$ is positive?
3.  What is the probability that $X$ is between 0.25 and 0.5?

### The number of miles that a particular car can run before its battery wears out is exponentially distributed with an average of 10,000 miles.

#### Problems
1. The mean of a probability distribution, $f(x)$, is given by $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x)\ dx$. Find $\lambda$ given that the average of this exponential distribution is 10,000.
2. What is the probability that a car with this battery will run for at least 5,000 miles.
3. If the battery should be replaced if the chance of failure is greater than 85\%, find the miles for recommended replacement.

### Suppose a random variable has the following probability distribution function:\[ f(x)=\begin{cases} c(1-x^2)&\qquad -1\le x\le 1\\0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]


<hr style="height: 2px; background-color: #003282;">

#### Problems
1. What must \(c\) be equal to for this to be a valid
distribution?
2. What is the median for \(X\)?
3. What is cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \(f(x)\)?
4. What is the expected value (mean) for \(X\)?
5. What is the variance for \(X\)?
6. What is the standard deviation for \(X\)?

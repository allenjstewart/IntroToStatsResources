<h4> Problems: </h4>

1. The City of Chicago would like to identify intersections which to place a police officer to prevent potential accidents and cite ticket violators. Due to budget restrictions they only want to place officers at intersections that have an average of 25 violations or more per day. Develop a hypothesis test to check and see if there should be an officer placed at the intersection of Hollywood and Sheridan. Be sure to identify $H_0$, $H_a$, whether you are using a $t$ or $z$ distribution (and why you choose that distribution), and you recommendation to the city. Also list any limitations in the data or process that might introduce inaccuracies.

<h4> Problems </h4>

1. Camera 1344 and 1343 are positioned in opposite directions (1343 points east on Hollywood and 1344 points West on Hollywood). Develop a hypothesis to check if people run a red light on one direction more than the other.

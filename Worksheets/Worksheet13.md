<h3> The Association of Governing Boards 2020 Trustee Index is the third annual survey of college and university board members about those issues they see as the most pressing facing the sector and the institutions they serve. This AGB survey, conducted in collaboration with Gallup, engaged trustees from across the nation about the value proposition for higher education and what they see as the major issues on the horizon. <br>
<br>
Results for the Association of Governing Boards (AGB) Trustee Index study are based on 10-minute web surveys conducted between October 7-November 3, 2019. AGB provided a random selection of 10,000 members, representative of AGBâ€™s membership, to be included in the study. In total, 919 members completed the survey. Gallup sent up to three reminders to nonresponders.
<br>
<br>
The survey found that 38% of board members from all sectors feel the most significant challenge facing their institution/system is the financial stability of the institution/system.

<h4> Problems:</h4>

1. What is the population of this survey? What was the response rate for this survey?
2. Is the sample size large enough to use the normal approximation for the sampling distribution of the estimator of the proportion?
3. Construct a 99\% confidence interval for the true proportion of the population that feels financial stability is the most significant challenge.
4. Based on your confidence interval, is there evidence that at least a third of all board members feel that financial stability is a significant challenge?
5. Using the simplified version of the confidence interval for a proportion, how does the margin of error change for different values of our sample proportion? Make a rough sketch of the margin of error as a function of the sample proportion.
6. What value of the sample proportion will give us the largest possible margin of error?
7. Use the result in the previous part to calculate what the largest sample size is that we could need to ensure that our margin of error is no more than 2\% for a 99\% confidence interval.

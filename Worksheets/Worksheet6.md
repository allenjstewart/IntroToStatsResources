<h3> The table below is a sample of the world petroleum consumption (WPC), in million barrels per day, and the US petroleum consumption (UPC) as a percent of world petroleum consumption.<sup><a href="fn1" id="ref1">*</a></sup>

| Year | 1975 | 1995 | 2002 | 2010 | 2016 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
|WPC (Million Barrels/day)   | 56.20  | 69.95  | 78.44  |  88.85  |  96.92 |
|UPC (% of WPC)   | 29.0  | 25.3  | 25.2  | 21.6  | 20.3  |

<h4>Problems:</h4>

1. Has the US petroleum consumption increased or decreased?
2. Make a scatterplot of the WPC vs UPC (be sure to include units on your axes).
3. Calculate $S_{xx}$, $S_{yy}$, and $S_{xy}$ where $x$ is the UPC (in million barrels/day) and $y$ is the WPC (in million barrels/day)
4. Calculate the sample correlation between US crude oil consumption and world oil consumption. Does the value calculated make sense relative to your graph on the previous page?
5. What can you say about the relationship between the world's oil consumption and the US's oil consumption?

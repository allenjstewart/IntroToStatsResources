<h3> The table below is a sample of the world petroleum consumption (WPC), in million barrels per day, and the US petroleum consumption (UPC) as a percent of world petroleum consumption.<sup><a href="fn1" id="ref1">*</a></sup>

| Year | 1975 | 1995 | 2002 | 2010 | 2016 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
|WPC (Million Barrels/day)   | 56.20  | 69.95  | 78.44  |  88.85  |  96.92 |
|UPC (% of WPC)   | 29.0  | 25.3  | 25.2  | 21.6  | 20.3  |

<h4> Problems: </h4>

1. Calculate $S_{xx}$, $S_{yy}$, and $S_{xy}$ where $x$ is the year and $y$ is the UPC (in million barrels/day)
2. Calculate the sample correlation between year and UPC. Does the value calculated make sense? What exactly does this number mean in terms of the data?
3. Find the equation of the least squares line predicting US petroleum consumption based on date.
4. What would you predict the US petroleum consumption to be for 2020?(This data has not been released yet by the BTS)

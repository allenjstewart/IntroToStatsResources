### For all problems on this worksheet, assume the lifetimes of all individual components are independent of one another. Suppose that the lifetime (in years) of a particular brand of fuse can be described by an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda=0.5$

<h4>Problems:</h4>

1. What is the probability that a randomly selected fuse lasts longer than some specificied time $t$?
2. Suppose we have a system of four such fuses connected in series, so that for the system to function, all four fuses must be working. What is the probability that the system is still functioning after some specified time $t$?
3. Now suppose instead we have a system with four such fuses running in parallel, so that for the system to function, at least one of the fuses must be working. What is the probability that the system is still functioning after some specified time $t$?
4. Now suppose we have a system with two components. The lifetime (in years) of the first component can be described by an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda=0.5$. The lifetime (in years) of the second component can be described by a normal distribution with mean of $2$ and a standard deviation of $0.3$. If the two components are connected in series, what is the probability the system will still be functioning after one and a half years?
5. Suppose we have the same two components from problem 4, but they are connected in parallel. What is the probability the system will still be functioning after one and a half years?

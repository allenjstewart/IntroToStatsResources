# Lab 6 - Probability

## Instructions
- Use the material covered in LAB 6(Probability) Notes     to answer the questions in this lab.
- Complete each of the problems in the required problems section.
- Choose only one of the listed projects and answer each of the associated questions
- Upload your answers to your questions.
- If your document is a notebook that contains code (for instance like an ipynb file), then upload a single file. here
- If you have a separate document that contains code then upload the code you used to answer the questions to LAB 6(Probability) CODE   

## Required Problems

Complete each of the problems below.

1. Calculate the probability of 5 out of 7 items being turned "on" when the probability of being turned on is 65%.
2. Calculate the probability that $X>5$ where $X$ is a random variable distributed according to a normal distribution with $\mu=4$ and $\sigma=2.2$
3. Calculate the probability of more than 6 events happening in a time period when the average number of events per period is 4.
4. Use mosaicData to upload CPS85 data set into your workspace and calculate the probability of a person being married  in 1985 given that they are female.

## Projects 

Choose one of the projects below and answer all associated questions.

### Project 1

The data set that we looked at in the lab notes was CPS85. We will investigate this data set further


1. Create a contingency table for the joint probabilities of getting paid over 6 dollars an hour and sex
2. What is the probability of a person getting paid less than or equal to 6 dollars an hour given that they are female?
3. Use the chi-square test to determine whether sex and getting paid over 6 dollars an hour are independent.
4. What is your interpretation of the result from the previous part?




### Project 2

In this lab we will use the NYCFLIGHTS13 data set to investigate relationships between air time and on time departure.

1. Create a contingency table for the joint probabilities of the flight being over 3 hours and leaving late
2. What is the probability of a a flight being over 3 hours given that it had a late departure time?
3. Use the chi-square test to determine whether air time over 3 hours and departure time are independent.
4. What is your interpretation of the result from the previous part?


### Project 3

In this project we will look at the Lahman data set to investigate the relationship between betting left and right handed and home runs.

1. Create a contingency table for the joint probabilities of batting left/right handed and hitting a home run.
2. What is the probability of a person being left handed given that they have hit a home run?
3. Use the chi-square test to determine whether batting left/right and hitting a hom run are independent.
4. What is your interpretation of the result from the previous part?

### Project 4

In this lab we will use the Movies.csv  data set to investigate the relationship between opening profit (revenue minus budget) and being a Disney film.

1. Create a contingency table for the joint probabilities of being a Disney film and having opening profit.
2. What is the conditional probability of making a profit during opening and being a Disney film?
3. Use the chi-square test to determine whether the two variables are independent.
4. What is your interpretation of the result from the previous part?


### Project 5

Find a data set of your choosing by any of the methods we have discussed previously. The data set must have at least two categorical variables.

1. Create a contingency table for the joint probabilities of the two variables
2. What is the conditional probabilities of the two variables?
3. Use the chi-square test to determine whether the two variables are independent.
4. What is your interpretation of the result from the previous part?
